Ok, you need to retrieve the router's password. They give you a .pcap file with a network capture and you need some program like wireshark (https://www.wireshark.org/) in order to inspect it.
Then, if you just ignore router sync traffic and look for requests between client and server (those using HTTP protocol), reading the ASCII content of some packets you can see that someone is using the control panel of a router.
Usually, to log in a website, a POST message is sent with the introduced user and password in order to check if they are correct. In this case, we can see this POST request:
```
    HTML Form URL Encoded: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
        Form item: "userid" = "randled"
            Key: userid
            Value: randled
        Form item: "pswrd" = "OFBGRW8wdHRIUQ=="
            Key: pswrd
            Value: OFBGRW8wdHRIUQ==
```
ÃŒf we check the ASCII raw value we can see that, instead of == it has %3D%3D but it's due to the encoding.
Finally, something ending like == is probably encoded in Base64, so you just need to decode it (http://base64decode.net/).
