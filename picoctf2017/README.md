Tuto is pretty easy hahaha

1) Just search for the name: ctrl + F -> Morris and look for the answer.

2) The note says it is using a ROT13 encryption, so just go to a ROT encryption page and paste the message. (http://www.rot13.com/)

3) They are just color shades in HEX. You just need to try them someplace (like googling them with a # before the number). 
The red shade is pretty easy to identify and the others are green, blue, brown..
